# covijab

We have created an application where an enterprise can delivery covid 19 vaccines to the organizations from where the client can make a request to receive the vaccine jab.

The system consists of:
Admin,
Manager,
Enterprises,
Organizations,
Deliveryman,
Client

In simple terms, an enterprise dispatches covid 19 vaccines to the organizations through a delivery man, and the organizations prepares the schedules using which the client makes a request to get the vaccine jab.
